A good example what we try to achieve is in 
https://github.com/JauniusPinelis/postman-testing-pipelines

Create a new github repository for this project.

Please do the following tasks.

1. You have application code in server.js
Create package.json with the needed dependencies.

2. Launch the application locally successfully.

3. Create a postman collection (no tests yet) where you perform CREATE, UPDATE, GET, GET by id, Delete.
Add your Postman collection to Github.

4. Cover the functionalities with postman tests.

5. Ensure that your tests are rerunnable. You can run postman collection several times.

6. Look at your tests quality, does changing application break your tests.

7. Run your tests with Newman package (have a command in package.json that does that).

8. Setup Github Action pipeline which runs the tests for you.
Copy and changing the url of https://github.com/JauniusPinelis/postman-testing-pipelines/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml
should do the job.
The tests should run when change is pushed to 'main'
